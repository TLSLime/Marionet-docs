IMPORTANT NOTICE
============================================================

This project consists of multiple components with different licenses.
Users must comply with all applicable licenses when building, using, or 
distributing this software.

CRITICAL DEPENDENCY NOTICE:

The rendering component of this project is designed to work with the GDCubism 
plugin, which in turn links with the Live2D Cubism SDK for Native. Without the 
GDCubism plugin, the rendering functionality cannot be used.

IMPORTANT: Other components of the framework (core logic, services, features) 
do NOT depend on Live2D SDK and can function independently. The Marionet 
framework itself retains its Apache 2.0 license regardless of whether Live2D 
components are used.

REPOSITORY CONTENTS:

This repository includes:
- Complete Godot project files
- C# source code for core framework
- GDCubism plugin integration code
- Live2D official free open-source model files (if any)

This repository does NOT include:
- Compiled GDCubism plugin binaries (.dll, .so, .dylib)
- Live2D Cubism SDK binaries or source code

NOTE: If this repository includes Live2D model files, these models are 
official free open-source models released by Live2D Inc., subject to their 
respective open-source licenses. User-created custom Live2D model files are 
not included in the repository and must be prepared by users themselves.

Users must compile the GDCubism plugin themselves or obtain pre-compiled 
binaries separately.

and remains so regardless of whether Live2D components are used. The Live2D 
license only affects distribution when the compiled application includes 
GDCubism binaries linked with Live2D SDK.

Users have the option to:

      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

2. GDCUBISM PLUGIN
============================================================

License: MIT License
Copyright: (c) 2023 MizunagiKB
Repository: https://github.com/MizunagiKB/gd_cubism

CRITICAL INFORMATION:

GDCubism is a Godot plugin that bridges Godot Engine with Live2D Cubism SDK.

The plugin source code itself is under MIT License. However, when the plugin 
is compiled, it links with the Live2D Cubism SDK for Native, creating a binary 
that is subject to Live2D's proprietary license terms.

DEPENDENCY SCOPE:

- The rendering component of Marionet is designed to work with GDCubism plugin
- Without GDCubism plugin binaries, Live2D rendering will not function
- Other framework components (services, features, core logic) can function 
  independently without GDCubism or Live2D SDK
- The Apache 2.0 license of the framework is not affected by the optional 
  use of Live2D components

MIT License Text:

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is

SOFTWARE.

3. LIVE2D CUBISM SDK FOR NATIVE
============================================================

License: Live2D Proprietary Software License
Copyright: Live2D Inc.
Website: https://www.live2d.com/

NOTE ON LIVE2D LICENSE INTERPRETATION:

The Live2D license applies to the combined work when GDCubism is compiled 
with Live2D SDK. The Marionet framework itself remains under Apache 2.0 
even when used with Live2D-enabled binaries.

This means:
- The Marionet core source code (Apache 2.0) can be freely used, modified, 
  and distributed independently
- When GDCubism plugin binaries (compiled with Live2D SDK) are integrated 
  into the project, distribution of the complete application requires 
  compliance with Live2D's license terms
- Users can choose to use Marionet framework without Live2D components, 
  remaining solely under Apache 2.0 terms

APPLICABILITY:

This license applies ONLY when:
1. You compile GDCubism plugin with Live2D Cubism SDK
2. You distribute the resulting compiled binaries
3. You use the rendering functionality that depends on Live2D

It does NOT apply to:
- Core framework components that do not use Live2D
- Development and testing with Live2D SDK
- Source code distribution without compiled binaries

LICENSE TYPES:

A. Development License (Free)
   Agreement: Live2D Open Software License
   URL: https://www.live2d.com/eula/live2d-open-software-license-agreement_en.html

B. Commercial Distribution License (Paid)
   Agreement: Live2D Proprietary Software License
   URL: https://www.live2d.com/eula/live2d-proprietary-software-license-agreement_en.html

      Contact: license@live2d.com
   
   3. Revenue share: Alternative to fixed fee
      Details: Contact Live2D Inc.

KEY RESTRICTIONS:

When you compile this project with Live2D Cubism SDK, the resulting binary 
becomes a derivative work that links with Live2D's proprietary libraries.

Distribution of such binaries requires:
- Compliance with Live2D Proprietary Software License
- Appropriate licensing based on usage scale
- Proper attribution and license notices

IMPORTANT: The Live2D SDK is NOT included in this repository. Users must 
download it separately from Live2D Inc. and accept their license agreement.

REGARDING LIVE2D MODEL FILES IN THIS REPOSITORY:

This repository may include Live2D model files for demonstration purposes. 
If included, these are:
- Official free open-source models released by Live2D Inc.
- Available from Live2D's official sample model repository
- Subject to their respective open-source licenses (typically allowing free use)
- NOT custom models created by the Marionet project

Users who wish to use custom Live2D models must:
- Create or obtain their own models

IMPORTANT: If you distribute binaries without obtaining proper Live2D 
licensing, you may be in violation of Live2D's proprietary software license.

ALTERNATIVE: DISTRIBUTING WITHOUT LIVE2D:

If you wish to distribute without Live2D licensing:
- Remove or replace the rendering component that uses GDCubism
- Use alternative rendering solutions
- Core framework functionality remains available under Apache 2.0
- The Marionet framework license (Apache 2.0) is unaffected by this choice
